# How to Check the Status of Your Refund

After a merchant issues a refund, you can track its status through your PayPro account. Hereâ€™s how to find out where your money is.

### For Refunds Issued Directly by the Merchant

When a merchant refunds you without a formal dispute, the process is straightforward.

1.  **Check Your Email:** You will receive an email from PayPro confirming that a refund was initiated.
2.  **Check Your PayPro Activity:**
    * Log in to your account and go to the **"Activity"** tab.
    * Find the original transaction. Its status will be updated to **"Refunded"** or **"Partially Refunded"**.
    * Click on the transaction for more details.

**Where is the money?**
* **If you paid by card:** The money is on its way back to your card-issuing bank. It can take **5-10 business days** from the date the refund was issued for it to appear on your statement. This timeline is controlled by the banks and card networks, not PayPro.
* **If you paid with your bank/balance:** The money is credited to your PayPro balance, usually within a few minutes.

### For Refunds from a Dispute (Claim)

If your refund is the result of a winning a dispute, you can track it in the Resolution Center.

1.  **Log in** and navigate to the **Resolution Center**.
2.  Find the closed case in your history.
3.  The case details will show the outcome and the refund amount.

The timeline for the money to appear in your account is the same as above once PayPro processes the refund from the closed case. If 10 business days have passed and you still don't see the credit on your card statement, contact your bank first, as they may have more information.
