# How to Reset Your Password

Forgetting a password happens to everyone. Follow these simple steps to securely reset your PayPro password and regain access to your account.

### Step 1: Go to the "Forgot Password" Page
On the PayPro login screen, click the **"Forgot Password?"** link located just below the password field.

### Step 2: Enter Your Email Address
You will be asked to enter the email address associated with your PayPro account. Enter it and click **"Send Reset Link"**.

### Step 3: Check Your Email
We will send a password reset link to your registered email address. This link is time-sensitive and can only be used once. If you don't receive it within a few minutes, check your spam folder.

### Step 4: Create a New Password
Clicking the link in the email will take you to a secure page where you can set a new password. Enter your new password twice to confirm it.

> **Important Security Note:** For your protection, you cannot reuse any of your previous 5 passwords. Choose a new, strong password that you haven't used before.

Once confirmed, you will be able to log in immediately with your new credentials.

### Still Having Trouble?
If you no longer have access to the email address on file, you will need to contact our support team directly to verify your identity.
