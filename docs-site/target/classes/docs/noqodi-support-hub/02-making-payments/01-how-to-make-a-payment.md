# A Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Payment

Using PayPro to pay is designed to be fast and secure. Hereâ€™s how it works when you're checking out on a merchant's website.

### Step 1: Select PayPro at Checkout
On the merchant's payment page, choose **"Pay with PayPro"** as your payment option.

### Step 2: Log in to Your PayPro Account
A secure PayPro window will pop up, prompting you to log in. Enter your email and password. If you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled, you will be asked to enter your verification code.

### Step 3: Choose Your Payment Method and Confirm
Once logged in, you'll see a summary of your purchase.
1.  **Select the payment method** you wish to use from your PayPro wallet (e.g., your saved Visa card or bank account).
2.  Verify the shipping address, if applicable.
3.  Click the **"Confirm and Pay"** or **"Pay Now"** button to complete the transaction.

### Step 4: Payment Confirmation
After a few seconds, the payment will be processed. You'll see a confirmation message in the PayPro window and be redirected back to the merchant's website, which will also show that your order was successful. You'll also receive an email receipt from both PayPro and the merchant.
