# Getting Started

Welcome to our API documentation. This site provides a comprehensive guide to integrating with our services.

## Overview

The documentation is divided into sections based on API resources. Each section provides:

- A **description** of the endpoint and its parameters in the middle pane.
- An **interactive API tester** on the right, allowing you to make live requests.

Select an endpoint from the menu on the left to begin.
