# How to Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a critical layer of security to your PayPro account. It requires you to provide a second piece of information (a code) in addition to your password, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

### Step 1: Navigate to Security Settings
1. Log in to your PayPro account.
2. Click on your profile icon and go to **"Settings"**.
3. Select the **"Security"** tab.

### Step 2: Set Up 2-Step Verification
Find the "2-Step Verification" section and click **"Set Up"**. You'll be asked to choose how you want to receive your security codes.

### Step 3: Choose Your 2FA Method

You have two primary options:

* **Use an Authenticator App (Recommended):** This is the most secure method. It uses an app on your phone (like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy) to generate time-sensitive codes.
    1.  Select "Use an authenticator app".
    2.  Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code shown on the screen.
    3.  Enter the 6-digit code from your app into the PayPro setup page to confirm.

* **Use SMS:** Receive codes via a text message to your phone.
    1.  Select "Use SMS".
    2.  Enter your mobile phone number and we will send you a code to verify it's yours.
    3.  Enter the code on the setup page.

### Step 4: Save Your Backup Codes
After setting up 2FA, you will be shown a set of **backup codes**. These are extremely important.

> **CRITICAL:** Save your backup codes in a safe place where you can access them if you lose your phone. A password manager or a printed copy in a secure location is ideal. Each code can only be used once.

Your account is now protected by 2FA! You will be asked for a code whenever you log in from a new device or perform sensitive actions.
