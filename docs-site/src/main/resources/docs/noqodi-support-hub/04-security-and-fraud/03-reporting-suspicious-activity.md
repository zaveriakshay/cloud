# How to Report Suspicious Activity on Your Account

If you notice a transaction you don't recognize or suspect someone has accessed your account without permission, it's crucial to act quickly.

### Step 1: Immediately Secure Your Account
Before doing anything else, prevent further unauthorized access.
1.  **[Reset Your Password](../01-account-management/02-resetting-your-password.md):** Choose a new, strong, and unique password.
2.  **Review Security Settings:** Check your personal information (address, phone number) and saved payment methods to ensure nothing has been changed. If you haven't already, [enable Two-Factor Authentication](./01-enabling-two-factor-auth.md) for maximum protection.

### Step 2: Identify and Report the Unauthorized Transaction
1.  Log in to your PayPro account and go to your **"Activity"** log.
2.  Find the transaction(s) you don't recognize.
3.  Click on the transaction to view its details.
4.  Select the **"Report a problem"** link.

### Step 3: File an "Unauthorized Transaction" Claim
When you report the problem, choose the option for **"Unauthorized activity in my account"**. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the necessary details.

This will open a formal investigation. We will temporarily lock your account from making further payments to protect you while we investigate.

### What Happens Next?
Our security team will investigate the claim, which can take up to 10 days. We will review the transaction details, login records, and other security data. We'll contact you via email with the outcome.

If we find that the transaction was indeed fraudulent, you are protected by our **Zero Liability Policy**, and we will refund you the full amount of the unauthorized charge.
