# Recognizing and Avoiding Phishing Scams

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to get your sensitive information (like passwords and credit card numbers) by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication, like an email or text message.

### How to Spot a Phishing Email or Message

Scammers are clever, but there are red flags to look for.

1.  **Urgent or Threatening Language:** Phishing emails often create a sense of panic. They might say "Your Account Has Been Suspended!" or "Unauthorized Login Attempt - Act Now!". PayPro will never ask you to provide sensitive information via email in a threatening manner.

2.  **Generic Greetings:** A legitimate email from PayPro will usually address you by your name. Be wary of generic greetings like "Dear Valued Customer" or "Hello PayPro User".

3.  **Suspicious Links and Sender Addresses:**
    * **Sender Email:** Look closely at the sender's email address. Scammers might use something that looks official but isn't, like `support@paypro-security.com` instead of `support@paypro.com`.
    * **Links:** Hover your mouse over any links **before** clicking them. The actual destination URL will pop up. If the link looks suspicious or doesn't match the text, don't click it.

4.  **Poor Grammar and Spelling:** While not always the case, many phishing emails contain obvious spelling mistakes or awkward grammar.

5.  **Unexpected Attachments:** Be extremely cautious of unsolicited attachments, even if they seem like invoices or receipts. They can contain malware.

### What to Do If You Suspect Phishing

* **DO NOT** click any links or download any attachments.
* **DO NOT** reply to the email.
* **DO** forward the suspicious email to our security team at `phishing@paypro.com`.
* **DO** delete the email from your inbox.

If you think you may have accidentally entered your credentials on a phishing site, immediately [reset your password](../01-account-management/02-resetting-your-password.md) and check your account for any [suspicious activity](./03-reporting-suspicious-activity.md).
