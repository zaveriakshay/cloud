# Understanding the Dispute Process (Chargebacks)

Opening a dispute is a formal way to resolve a problem with a transaction when you can't solve it with the seller. This is a last resort and should only be used for valid reasons.

### Valid Reasons to Open a Dispute
* **Item Not Received (INR):** You paid for an item, but the seller never delivered it.
* **Significantly Not as Described (SNAD):** The item you received is vastly different from what the seller described (e.g., you received a used item when it was advertised as new, a key feature is missing, or it's a counterfeit).
* **Unauthorized Transaction:** You see a PayPro transaction on your account that you did not authorize. Please also see [How to Report Suspicious Activity](../04-security-and-fraud/03-reporting-suspicious-activity.md).

### The Dispute Process: A Timeline

1.  **Open the Dispute (Within 180 days):**
    * Find the transaction in your PayPro **Activity** log.
    * Click on it and select **"Report a problem"**.
    * Follow the prompts to describe your issue and what you want to happen (e.g., a full refund).

2.  **Communication Phase (Up to 20 days):**
    * This opens a direct communication channel with the seller within the PayPro Resolution Center. You and the seller can exchange messages and try to work things out. Many disputes are resolved at this stage.

3.  **Escalate to a Claim (Optional):**
    * If you can't agree, you can escalate the dispute to a claim. This means you are asking PayPro to step in and make a decision. **You must escalate within 20 days, or the dispute will close automatically.**

4.  **PayPro Investigation (10-30+ days):**
    * We will investigate the claim by reviewing the evidence provided by both you and the seller (e.g., tracking numbers, photos, emails). We may ask for more information.

5.  **Final Decision:**
    * We will make a final decision. If the case is decided in your favor, you will receive a full refund. If it's decided in the seller's favor, the case is closed. The decision is final.
