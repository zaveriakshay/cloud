# How to Request a Refund from a Merchant

If you're unsatisfied with a purchase or didn't receive an item, the first step is always to contact the seller directly to request a refund. PayPro facilitates payments, but refund policies are set by the merchant.

### Step 1: Contact the Merchant
Find the contact information for the merchant from your order confirmation email or their website. Explain the situation clearly and politely, and state that you are requesting a refund. Most merchants are happy to resolve issues directly.

> **Tip:** Keep a record of your communication with the seller, including dates and a summary of what was discussed.

### Step 2: The Merchant Issues the Refund via PayPro
If the merchant agrees to the refund, they will initiate it from their PayPro dashboard. You don't need to do anything further on your end.

### Step 3: Refund Confirmation
Once the merchant processes the refund, you will receive an email notification from PayPro. The status of the original transaction in your **Activity** log will change to "Refunded".

### How Refunds Are Credited
* **Paid with Credit/Debit Card:** The refund will be sent back to the card you used. It can take **5-10 business days** for the credit to appear on your statement, depending on your bank's processing times.
* **Paid with Bank Account / PayPro Balance:** The refund will be credited back to your PayPro balance almost instantly.

### What if the Merchant Doesn't Respond or Refuses a Refund?
If you cannot resolve the issue with the seller directly, you may be able to open a dispute. See our guide on [Understanding the Dispute Process](./02-how-disputes-work.md).
