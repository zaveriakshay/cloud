# Troubleshooting Failed Payments

It can be frustrating when a payment fails. This guide covers the most common reasons for a declined transaction and how to fix them.

When a payment fails, PayPro provides a general reason. Check your **Activity** log for details on the specific transaction.

### Reason 1: Incorrect Billing Information
The billing address, ZIP/postal code, or CVV (the 3-digit code on the back of your card) you entered doesn't match the information your bank has on file.

* **Solution:** Go to your PayPro [Wallet](../01-account-management/03-updating-billing-info.md), remove the card, and add it again, carefully checking that all information is correct.

### Reason 2: Insufficient Funds
Your bank account or credit card does not have enough funds to cover the transaction amount.

* **Solution:** Check your bank balance or credit limit. Add funds to your account or use a different payment method.

### Reason 3: Bank Declined the Transaction
Your bank's fraud prevention system may have blocked the charge. This is common for:
* Unusually large purchases.
* First-time purchases with a new merchant.
* International transactions.

* **Solution:** Contact your bank's customer service line (the number is on the back of your card) and let them know you authorize the charge from "PayPro". They can unblock it for you.

### Reason 4: Expired Card
The card you are trying to use has passed its expiration date.

* **Solution:** [Update your card information](../01-account-management/03-updating-billing-info.md) in your PayPro Wallet with your new card's details.

If you have tried all these steps and the payment still fails, please contact PayPro support with the transaction ID and any error messages you received.
