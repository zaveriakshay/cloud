# Understanding Payment Statuses

When you make a payment or view your transaction history, each transaction has a status. Here's what they mean.

### How to View Your Transaction History
1. Log in to your PayPro account.
2. Navigate to the **"Activity"** or **"History"** tab.
3. You will see a list of all your recent transactions and their statuses.

### Common Payment Statuses

* **Completed:** Success! The payment was sent from your account and received by the merchant. No further action is needed.

* **Pending:** The payment is in progress. This can happen for several reasons:
    * **eCheque/Bank Transfer:** Payments from a bank account can take 3-5 business days to clear. The status will remain "Pending" until the funds are transferred.
    * **Merchant Action Required:** The merchant has not yet accepted or "captured" the payment. This is common for pre-orders or hotel bookings.
    * **Security Review:** In rare cases, our system may hold a payment for a brief security review to protect your account.

* **Failed / Declined:** The payment did not go through. The funds have not been taken from your account. See our guide on [Troubleshooting Failed Payments](./03-troubleshooting-failed-payments.md) for common causes and solutions.

* **Refunded:** The merchant has returned the funds to you. The money will be credited back to your original payment method (your PayPro balance, card, or bank account). It may take several business days for the refund to appear on your card or bank statement.

* **Reversed:** The payment was returned to you because the recipient did not claim it or a dispute was decided in your favor. The funds are returned to your PayPro balance or original funding source.
